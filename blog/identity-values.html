<h1 class="heading">Core Personal Values:</h1>
<h2 class="sub">Situation where I have made an ethical descision:</h2>
<p>My dog was about 8 years old and was starting to slow down and not act herself anymore. I took her to the vet and found that she had cancer all over her
body. About a month after I had found this out, her condition was declining rapidly. Me and my family made the decision that the best thing
for her was for her to be euthanized. So we took her to the vet for the last time where she drew her last breath peacefully.</p>

<p>
When I weighted up the options with my family, we realised that the dog would either, live for a few more months on pain and suffering or
live for another week with reduced pain and suffering. We agreed that the latter was the best option for her.</p>
<h2 class="sub">An descision influenced by culture?</h2>
<p>
I don't think culture has anything to do with the decision that was made. Respect for quality of life is seen across all cultures.
In general I don't associate my culture with my identity but it is fair to say that our upbringing is a major factor in who we are shaped to be
even in our later lives. My family values kindness, education and hard work to get the rewards that we desire. These are also values that I hold.</p>

<h2 class="sub">My Strenghts</h2>
<p>
My strenghths are that I am able to knowingly make a big decision that can change the course of my life. For example going to Germany for 9 months on a student
exchange and quitting my old job as a fully qualified mechanic to do this course through dev academy. I also like to challenge my self. I am currenly learing piano and 
have started learning pieces that are well above my skill level. While it takes me months to learn a piece, I am able to persist and can find satisfaction in
seeing only a slight improvement.
</p>
<h2 class="sub">My Limitations</h2>
<p>
My limitaions with my career development include starting a career path for the sake of it and feeling a pressure to begin any kind of tertiary education.
I have attended university before but failed to finish my degree because I lost interest in it. In hindsight the best thing to have done would have been to work
until I am sure I know what my goal is in life. I think the situation could have been avoided if I had asked for help but I don't want somebody else to dictate the
path my life should take so I actively avoid such situations. This is another weakness of mine. I keep within my own head and I'm to reserved and reluctant to share my thoughts
and opinions on something that I think could be controversial or might change the way people think about me.
</p>


<h2 class="sub">How my Strengths Will Intersect with Learning Obstacles</h2>
<p>
Being a qualified mechanic, I am able to think in a way to solve problems. Working on cars required a lot of problem solving ability. Cars are run by computers that have inputs via sensors
and outputs via acuators. In other words everything is run by a system, the fault may show its symptom in one part of the system but actually be present in another part of the
system. Diagnosic skills in the automotive industry require you to look at the system as a whole. Leaping to a conclusion without looking at the bigger picture can result in a misdiagnosic
This skill of looking at a system as a whole could help me overcome obstacles when programming too.</p>

<h2 class="question">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time,
 how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2>

<p>One time it was a very busy day and we were understaffed. I was covering for one of my colleagues as he went on break. Under normal circumstances we would be able to have more than one person 
go on a break at one time. This day it wasn't feasible due to the staff numbers. When my colleague was back it was my turn. We were already behind schedule for our breaks but it didn't worry
me that much. When I got back I was drilled into by another colleague that was rivited that he didn't take his break on time. I said to him that It is not unreasonable that he had to take his
break later because we all worked the same amount of hours before taking our breaks. (He started later than any other staff member). He response to my reasoning was to "just drop it" and 
he stormed off in a fit. I then informed the manager of the situation who took absolutely no action and said "that's just want he is like". My stratigie was completely ineffective trying to reason with him and explain the situation clearly.
If I was to come across a similar situation with the same staff member today I would opt for the solution of completely ignoring them and carrying on with my work. Then again if it was anyone else I would pre-evaluate their
responce to my reasoning. "would this person react this way?" If so I will say this "...." Would this person react that way I would say this "...."
This is because different people react differently to different situtaions. It may depend on the mood that they are in on the day, or it may depend on their core character. Judging character is a fundamental part of finding out how someone will react 
in a given circumstance.</p>
