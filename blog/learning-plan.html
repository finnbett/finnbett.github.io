    <h1 class="heading">My Learning Plan</h1>
   <h2 class="question"> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
<p>I want to become a web developer.</p>


<h2 class="question">A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
<h2 class="sub">Strenghts:</h2> 
<p>I am able to take on challenging tasks that are beyond my skill level. For example I am learning piano at the moment and have taken on difficuilt pieces outside of my current skill level. I if find something interesting,
I will persue that challenge until I feel competent in that area.

<h2 class="sub">Limitations:</h2>
<p>I can be too focused on one aspect of a challenge that I am having trouble with, when I should be moving on to something different.</p>


<h2 class="question">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
<p>Communication and teamwork skills</p>

<h2 class="question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>
<p>I will take regular breaks as I need them, suggest to others that they could take a break if I think they are being over worked.
    <br>
I will set tasks to complete and complete tasks set by others, with appropiate timeframes and deligate tasks to others where nessessary.
<br>
I will communicate any concerns and problems with the facilitators and understand that I am one of many that are doing the course and everyone has different needs and goals that they have set
by doing the course. Because of this, the facilitators are accomodating many different types of people with different needs at once.
<br> Industry leaders are wise in the field that they are in
and any advise and industry secrets they share are worth gold. </p>


<h2 class="question">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h2>
<p>Increase allocated time and break down the tasks into manageable chunks so that the progress can become measureable.</p>

<h2 class="question">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>

<p>Google is the number one source of information to seak help. Following that, the slack channel and then course facilitators</p>

<h2 class="question">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h2>
<p>Clear instructions and clear outlining of tasks and advise when asked.</p>

<h2 class="question">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h2>
<p>I will continue piano on Mondays.</p>
