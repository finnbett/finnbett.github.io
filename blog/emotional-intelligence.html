  <h1 class="heading">EQ vs IQ</h1>
  
  <h2 class="sub">Emotional Intelligence and Intelligence Quotient</h2>
 <h2 class="sub">Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
    Emotional intelligence is the awareness and self realisation of your emotions. 
    Once you can understand your emotions, managing them becomes more achievable.
    At the lowest level of emotional intelligence, just being able to express your emotions os a form of EQ.
    At the highest level it is about obtaining control over your emotions and being able to manage them. 
    The purpose of EQ is to improve well-being and help achieve academic success.
    </p>
    <br> 
    <p>
    EQ in action will result in the following:
    Thinking before reacting, achieving greater self awareness, expressing empathy to others.
    accepting criticism and taking responsiblity. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="list"> Some examples of high EQ in practice are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Overcoming a mistake.</li>
    <li>Being able to say no.</li>
    <li>Being able to listen to others.</li>
    <li>Being aware of your actions and why you are doing them.</li>
    <li>Avoiding judegment of others.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
    Those that have a low EQ tend to have poor social skills and are likely to have poor relationships, get into arguments often, have a poor understanding of how others are feeling.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    On the other end of the spectrum it is actually possible to have a emotional intelligence level that is too high.
    People with a high EQ tend to be less innovative and creative, struggle to deliver negative feedback.
    Also those that have a better EQ are able to take control over their emotions so they can supress their actual emotions if they want to.
    Also their emotional understanding is greater of other people so they have the ablility to manipulate others by targeting their emotions in a specific way to achieve an outcome they desire.
    </p>
    <p>
    It should be clear that obtaining a high EQ level doesn't make somebody a better person but just gives them powerful social skills.
    <p>
    <h2 class="sub">Intelligence Quotient</h2>
    <p>    
    IQ is diffent from EQ as it involves cognitive skills that are used for solving problems and is accociated with logic skills as opposed to human/social skills.
    IQ is the hard skill set that is used for solving tasks and problems but EQ is soft skills relating to emotion management. </p>
