        <h2 class="question">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>I work best if I have a clear mind. If I get stuck on something, it is normally something that I am able to do but I just need to reset my mind. My most productive time is when I have been able to build my own confidence through completing tasks and achieving goals.</p>

        <h2 class="question">What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>The role of values, empathy and self awareness is to obtain and build a "growth mindset" and build a high "EQ" whereby we are striving to become more considerate, resilient, motivated, caring- both for our self and others while being fully aware of our selves and thus able to take control of our emotions.</p>

        <h2 class="question">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>The thing that suprised me the most with the core learning was that it actually has a positive effect on the productiveity of my work. I feel that I am a more productive individual because I have practiced core learning.</p>

        <h2 class="question">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>The most challenging aspects of the core learning was trying to access yourself. It is difficult to assess yourself because you are not sure if you are being too hard on your self or you are being easy to yourself. To destroy your ego and take a perspective on yourself from outside of your mind is one of the best ways to assess yourself I find. However its still challenging to do.</p>

        <h2 class="question">Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>Web developers work in teams and if you have good human skills you will be a good asset to any team. On the other hand you might be great at web development but if you are not a nice person, you will not fit well in a team. The second reason is that having good core skills can be a good way to help deal with the pressures of work associated with web development. </p>
        
        <h2 class="question">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>No, it is not a waste of time. I could have spent that time programming and I would have gained more skills in programming but then I wouldn't have gained the skills outlined in the above answer.</p>
