        <h2 class="sub">The Time I got Stuck on a Simple Problem</h2>
            <p>One time I got stuck on a simple problem was during the "fizz buzz" challenge. In the "fizz buzz" challenge, one must write code that will receive a number and if that number is a multiple of 3, it will replace that number with the word "fizz" and if that number was a multiple of 5, it would replace that number with the word "Buzz." Finally if the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it should replace the number with the word "FizzBuzz."
                <br> 
            The challenge that I was doing was similar to this but took an array of numbers (which is a list of numbers) and then replaced those numbers with the corresponding words.
                <br>
            The thing that I had trouble with was that I couldn't select all of the required items in the array to have the number replaced by the word. I tried to google the solution but didn't get the search results that I was after. After some time I was feeling a bit fustrated with myself. I thankfully came unstuck though the help of a fellow student when I asked for help in our chat room.

        <h2 class="sub">Elegant Solution</h2>
            <p>One time I came up with an elegant solution was when I had the challenge of reversing text to make it readable (the text was back to front). I noticed the fuction was already started for me but I had another way to solve the problem. I googled an example if the function that I had in mind and it seemed like it would work for this function as well. So I removed the function that was started for me and did my own function from scratch to see of my function would also pass the test. It did! I felt good knowing that my solution also gave the correct outcome to pass the test even though the method was different to the method that the challenge was suggesting to use. I learned that there are many ways to solve a problem and the best way to solve the problem is the one that you understand the best.

        <h2 class="sub">Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pseudocode:
                    <p>Pseudocode is a problem solving technique where you write out in plain english (or which ever language you want) what you approach to solving the problem is. You can write the pseudocode as a comment so the comment wont become executed as part of the code. I find it helpful for drafting out a plan for the code I will write.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Trying something
                    <p>Sometimes the best way to solve a problem quickly is just to try out something. There is not really anything to loose with this method. Sometimes there has been cases where I am not sore about syntax so I would just add a semi-colon or a comma to line of code to see of it solves my problem. It can be a quick simple way of fixing the issue.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Rubber ducky method
                    <p>The rubber duck represents somebody that will just sit there and listen to your plan of how you will code. The idea is that you will explain to the duckwhat your plan is but you may find that you are not doing what you were explaining to the duck. In otherwords it is just a way of thinking out loud. You could even explain what you are doing to your dog and the concept will stay the same. I talk to myself or my dog enough to clarfiy for myself what my plan of attack for a problem is.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Reading error messages
                    <p>Often error messages can give you a quick solution to the probelm you are having with the code. For example, an error message might say "missing { on line 16" or somthing similar. Reading these is very helpful for me when debuggig code.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Console.logging
                    <p>Console.logging provides an insight to your code at any time. If you are not sure if your array is working, or your function is working, you can just console.log() to see what is happening at a given point in time and you will have a "window" into your code.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Googling
                    <p>Google is the number one source of information to find out what you need. If there is something that I want to find out or research, chances are that it is on Google. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Asking your peers for help
                    <p>If I am feeling stuck on a problem then I will ask my peers for help. Normally somebody has come across the same problem or somebody has alreasy solved the problem so they know how to solve it. The chat room is very helpful.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Asking coaches for help
                    <p>Sometimes there could be a problem that is too difficult for my peers to help me with or I could remain stuck on a problem. In a case like this it is good to know that there are coaches that can help me with problems.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Improving your process with reflection
                    <p>It is important to replect on your skills once you have completed a challenge as there is normally a way you could have improved your approach to it. Either by applying a different problem solving technique or by coming up with a more optimal solution. I ask my self after completing a task: "how could I have done this better? What skills are lacking that prevented me from completing this task without issues? What problem solving technique could have prevented me from struggling with this task?</p>
